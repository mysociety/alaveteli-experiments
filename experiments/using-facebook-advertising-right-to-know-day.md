# Using Facebook advertising on Right To Know Day: What effect does it have?

- [issue#100](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli-experiments/issues/100)

On 28th Septemebr 2016 (International Right To Know Day), we tested out the following Facebook advert experiments across a few Alaveteli sites: 

**Advert experiment 1: Browse requests vs. Make requests**

For this experiment, we compared one advert that encouraged people to **make a request** with another advert that encouraged people to **browse requests**.

Sites that did this experiment:  

- [WhatDoTheyKnow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) (UK) 
- [AskYourGov](http://askyourgov.ug/) (Uganda)
- [AsktheEU](https://www.asktheeu.org/)  

**Advert experiment 2: Prompts vs. No prompts**

For this experiment, we compared one advert that included **suggested requests** to make with another advert that **didn't include any suggestions**.

Sites that did this experiment:

- [ImamoProZnati](http://imamopravoznati.org/) (Croatia)
- [KiMitTud](http://kimittud.atlatszo.hu/) (Hungary)
- [Sobanukirwa](https://sobanukirwa.rw/) (Rwanda) 
- [RightToKnow](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/) (Australia)

**Target audience**

The target audience for each advert was everyone in the country where the site operates. However, for the AsktheEU adverts, we set the target audience for the adverts to UK, Spain and France.

**Advert run length**

Each advert was only run for 24 hours. 

**Budget**

Each Alaveteli site had a budget of $50

## Answer

**TL;DR:** Facebook ads bring traffic/new users to Alaveteli sites, but not a lot. Only 0.5% of people who saw the ads then visited an Alaveteli website. 

Only one person went on to make a request after seeing a Facebook advert. 

The most effective places to use Facebook advertising seem to be Uganda and Rwanda, as you reach more people and get more clicks for your money. 

## Analysis
