# Test test?

A summary of the experiment, explaining why it is important or interesting to know the answer. Can be a sentence or an essay. In the case of longer summaries, consider the [F-shaped](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/) pattern of reading.

## Answer

**TL;DR:** A very short answer to the question, based on the results. Can be as simple as "Yes" or "No".

Optional discussion about the experiment results, if they needs more explanation or caveats. As with the experiment summary, this can be a sentence or an essay.

## Analysis

What data did you look at and how did you arrive at the above answer?

Use your discretion. If you're simply comparing stats in Google Analytics, just say so, and maybe point to how someone else could find the same report in their own Analytics account. If we did something more involved, then steps to reproduce are encouraged. For example, rather than saying "we queried the database", provide the actual query.

### Data

Provide any relevant data. This can be inline in the experiment writeup document (in the form of tables, lists or whatever is most useful) or linked to in supporting documents with a summary here.

Simple stats can be put in to a table:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 1      | 20    |

Screenshots can be rendered in to the experiment writeup or linked to. Place any supporting files in a directory with the same name as the experiment document for ease of use:
