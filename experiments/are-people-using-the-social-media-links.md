but is anybody clicking on them?

## Answer

**TL;DR:** Yes. But it's a very small percentage of visitors.

## Analysis

Recent data from WhatDoTheyKnow.com shows that the links are being used by a
small proportion of site visitors, and that the clicks are predominantly going to
the Twitter links.

To get this result, we looked at data from 11 - 24 May 2016. In this period,
Google Analytics records that 262,525 people visited the site over 306,940
sessions. Of these, around 124 sessions recorded clicks for our Social Media
Event links which equates to around **0.04%** of recorded sessions.
