# Will social media links increase growth?

How heavily is social media used in different countries? Which social sites get
the most traffic?

- [issue#10](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli-experiments/issues/10)

## Answer

**TL;DR:** Maybe; it depends. From the range of results below it seems fair to
say that there may not be a definitive answer to this one. However Facebook is 
the most popular social network in most territories, with Twitter a distant 3rd,
at best, outside the UK (within our chosen dataset) so we should probably target
future efforts accordingly.

That said, it is not clear whether any of these stats take app usage (via public
APIs) into account which would probably still give Facebook a healthy lead but
might give a truer picture of the state of the market.

## Analysis

A list of top social media sites for selected countries will allow us to
experiment in a country-specific way. Data gleaned from
[Stats Monkey's social media categories](https://www.statsmonkey.com/tags/3391-social-media.php)
for their useful sector analysis percentages (although their splitting of desktop
and mobile listings isn't entirely helpful) and
[Alexa's per country rankings](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries). Please
note that Alexa does not offer either percentage breakdowns or a social media
category so our resulting table summaries may be subject to human error.

Stats Monkey rankings are for 2015 (the most recent set available at time of
writing), Alexa's are as advised at the foot of each table as their rankings are
said to be updated daily.
