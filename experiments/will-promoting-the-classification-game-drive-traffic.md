# Will promoting the classification game help drive traffic?

Is the classification game underused? Is there scope for it to increase the
number of transactions on the site?

- [issue#51](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli-experiments/issues/51)

## Answer

**Maybe:** it varies from site to site but in most cases "yes". The classification
game does not get many visitors but some sites have such a high classification
rate that there would be very little that a passing classifier could do.

## Analysis

In late February 2016, the overall picture looked like this:

| Country | Percentage categorised | Unclassified requests | 
| ------- | ---------------------: | --------------------: |
| Australia      | 99.94% |    1 |
| Croatia        | 99.70% |    3 |
| Czech Republic | 95.52% |  214 |
| Hungary        | 91.44% |  529 |
| The EU         | 87.19% |  334 | 
| Ukraine        | 66.34% | 3148 |
 
All the Gold Level sites (which excludes Ukraine) have an above 85%
categorisation rate, which is encouraging, but with Australia and Croatia in
particular in a position where directing new people to the categorisation game
could result in them having very little - if anything - to do.

Unfortunately it is not currently possible to say for certain what percentage
of these classifications came from the classification game as opposed to the
action of the original requester. While for sites hosted by mySociety, we could
attempt to dig into the database to see if we can find the answer, the only
publicly available measure of the use of the game is by adding up the "scores"
in the "All time best players" top 10 (which could only be presumed to be a fully
accurate indication of usage if the list contains fewer than 10 entries).

Google Analytics gives us a bit more of a clue by showing visits to the
categorisation game landing page:

| Country        | Page views |
| -------------- | ---------: |
| Australia      |   147
| Croatia        |    44
| Czech Republic |   n/a
| Hungary        |     2
| The EU         |    30
| Ukraine        |     3
| UK             | 3,005

While this is not the same as the number of classifications made, as this is the
start point for the game (so we would expect users to drop off after this point),
it looks as though the game isn't getting much use, particularly outside the UK.
