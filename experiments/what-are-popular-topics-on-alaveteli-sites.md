# What are popular topics on Alaveteli sites?

In order to help us let potential users know that an Alaveteli site exists, it
would be useful to know where on the web they're already spending time.
Understanding what popular topics are for a given Alaveteli site could help us
infer where else potential users might be.

- [issue#5](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli-experiments/issues/5)

## Answer

**TL;DR**: There are no clear results from our first attempt to answer this question.
The topic results are not comprehensive, merely indicative. Particular kinds of
requests e.g for costs, contracts, do appear frequently. AskTheEU has the clearest
popular topics - lobbying and trade agreements - represented in both a sample of
requests and the most viewed requests on the site.

## Analysis

We don't currently have a tagging system available to Alaveteli users. Nor do we
have back-end access to some of the Gold Level sites. So it is difficult to
understand what topics are popular on a given site. Given the means we have
available, we took a sample of 100 consecutive requests from each Gold Level
site - those that are achieving a relatively high level of traffic and/or
transactions. We did this using the date filter on the search interface. Where
necessary, we translated the title and body of each request into English using
Google Translate. We then tried to pull out common topics by eye and counted how
many requests related to each one. We didn't require the topics to be mutually
exclusive i.e. one request can be counted as relating to multiple topics. We
also looked to see what the most common authorities were in the lists (those
appearing 4 times or more), and were able to cross check that for some sites
with the data from the public body statistics page on the site.

One issue with getting the requests using the search interface is that the
topics can be strongly influenced by someone making a series of related requests
in the time period specified. Whether consistent topics appear is highly
determined by whether there is a series of related requests in the requests
sampled. Ideally we would use a larger sample size and random selection but in
that case we would need a less labour-intensive method of analysing the topics.

The query used to retrieve the data for each site is in cell A1 of each sheet.
