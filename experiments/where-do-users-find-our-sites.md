# Where do users find out about Alaveteli sites?

Where is our existing traffic being referred from? Where might there be
potential users that we're not currently reaching?

- [issue#4](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli-experiments/issues/4)

## Answer

**TL;DR:**
* referred traffic predominantly from social media sites (primarily Facebook)
* sites with a strong journalistic focus get a greater proportion of traffic
from news and campaign sites
* referrals account for about 7-13% of site traffic
* on the whole backlinks don't generate direct traffic, but its likely that they
indirectly help by improving search ranking and raising site awareness

## Analysis

As we studied two types of data in our search for a clearer picture, we've split
the analysis detail into two sections:

### [Referrer data](where-do-users-find-our-sites/referrer-analysis.md)
Sites and pages that visitors to our sites found us from.

### [Backlinks](where-do-users-find-our-sites/backlink-analysis.md)
Also called "incoming links", links that point to our sites (and, as above, help
with search ranking etc) but aren't necessarily being clicked on by users.
