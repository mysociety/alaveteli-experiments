# Where do users find out about Alaveteli sites?

Where is our existing traffic being referred from? Where might there be
potential users that we're not currently reaching?

- [issue#4](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli-experiments/issues/4)

## Answer

**TL;DR:**
* referred traffic predominantly from social media sites (primarily Facebook)
* sites with a strong journalistic focus get a greater proportion of traffic
from news and campaign sites
* referrals account for about 7-13% of site traffic
* on the whole backlinks don't generate direct traffic, but its likely that they
indirectly help by improving search ranking and raising site awareness

## Analysis

This has turned out to be a more complex question than we first realised so we're
going to try to update this as we find out more.

We have two types of data available:

* Hard data from Google Analytics (only available for sites that have Google
Analytics set up and the site owners have granted us access to have a look round)
about which links the people who are visiting our sites have clicked to reach us.  
* More tentative stuff about where there are large clusters of links that point
to our sites (which, as you will see if you slog through the data, can get
a bit swamped by aggregators and similar listing/indexing projects). These are
potentially a way to find out where people are talking about our sites and seeing
if we can drive traffic from them (or conversely to see wonder if there is
the potential to ask nicely for more links from sites which are sending us traffic
but don't appear in this dataset). Although without strong correlations between
linkers and traffic creators (referrers), it might turn out that these kinds of
links are more useful for reputational purposes - they're reportedly part of the
complex calculation that Google uses to work out how to weight its search
results - than this sort of analysis.
