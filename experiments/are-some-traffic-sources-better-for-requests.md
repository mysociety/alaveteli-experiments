# Are some sources of traffic better in terms of people making requests?

Are visitors from any particular traffic source more likely to make requests?

- [issue#47](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli-experiments/issues/47)

## Answer

**TL;DR:** Social media, the smallest but most engaged set of users.

## Analysis

Based on 2 months of Ask The EU's data, it appears that people who find the site
via social media are more likely than any other group to go on to make a request.

Source Type    | % of group making requests | % traffic (sessions)
-------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------
Organic Search |  1.35%   | 57.19%
Direct         |  3.93%   | 29.54%
Referral       |  2.69%   |  9.33%
Social         | 11.32%   |  3.94%

(Data sample 16/3/16 - 15/5/16)

Although it does lead to a secondary question - if the amount of traffic from
social media rises, will we retain that high percentage of measurable engagement
or will it be become diluted?
