# Can we drive traffic to AsktheEU from our newsletter/blog post?

Originally, we wanted to answer this question: Can we drive traffic from campaigning orgs/news outlets in UK covering upcoming EU referendum? But we decided the most non-parisan way of doing this was to just send out a newsletter and publish a [blog post](https://www.mysociety.org/2016/05/16/inform-yourself-before-the-referendum/) pointing people towards AsktheEU and other helpful websites ahead of the EU Referendum.

## Answer

**TL;DR:** Yes, and no. A very tiny % of traffic from newsletter, but no traffic from blog post (at time of writing, 14 June 2016). 

Since sending out the newsletter on 16 May 2016 to today's date (14 June 2016), there have only been 24 clicks (22 being unique) through to AsktheEU.org from the newsletter.

It looks like 32 sessions came from the newsletter - with one person going on to make a request.

It doesn't look as though any traffic came from AsktheEU from the [blog post](https://www.mysociety.org/2016/05/16/inform-yourself-before-the-referendum/). 

## Analysis

The '24 clicks' stat from newsletter came from MailChimp report statistics.

The '32 sessions' stat came from looking at AsktheEU's Google Analytics - 'Acquisition' - 'Channels' - 'Referral', and then 'outlook.live.com' is in this list. From doing a Google search, this implies that this is traffic from an email client that been used to open newsletter.

Data sample was taken from 14/05/2016 - 13/06/2016.
