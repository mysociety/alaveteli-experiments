# Would admins prefer mySociety host their Alaveteli?

We're interested in knowing this to find out how much of a burden the technical responsibility of running an Alaveteli is.

- [issue#7](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli-experiments/issues/7)

## Answer

**TL;DR:** On the whole, yes.

## Analysis

We already host several partner Alavetelis.

- Croatia: Yes
- Hungary: Yes, but want to have access to mail server logs for proof of delivery
- Czech Republic: Yes (we already manage their servers)
- Australia: Warm to the idea, but concerned about latency and loss of control
