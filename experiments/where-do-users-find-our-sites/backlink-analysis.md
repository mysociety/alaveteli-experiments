# Backlinks (Incoming Links) Analysis

Sites where links to Alaveteli sites can be found but are not necessarily driving
traffic. Data for this was sourced from [Majestic's SEO tool](http://majestic.com),
one of 2 services commonly recommended for this kind of link tracking, selected
on the grounds that it allows basic reports to be generated without committing
to a paid subscription.

In theory analysis of these results should tell us where people are talking
(or writing) about our sites so that we can decide whether it would be useful
to engage with them (or their users).

These links should also be responsible for indirectly driving traffic to the
sites by affecting search engine rankings. Inbound links are reportedly part of
the complex calculation that Google (and others) use to work out their search
rankings so it's worth encouraging people to write about us whether there's a
directly measurable effect in the Google Analytics referrer table or not.

On the whole there is not much effect on referrals from all these links, with
the following notable exceptions:

* corporateeurope.org accounts for 7.72% of referral traffic to the EU site
* atlatszo.org accounts for 10.70% of referral traffic to Hungary's Alaveteli
* codeforcroatia.org accounts for 13.47% of referral traffic for Croatia

## Limitations

There is quite a bit of noise in the results as there is a tendency for
aggregators and similar listing/indexing projects - as well as major civic tech 
projects with backlinks on each page, which could run to tens of thousands (e.g. "electionleaflets.org.au") - to push the kind of sites we were hoping to discover
out of the top 10. The only way to filter these out or see more than just a top
10 summary is to take out a paid subscription to a link checking service, which
does not seem like a good investment at this stage.

These links also appear to have limited potential for directly driving traffic.
Where Analytics data is available, the final column of each table shows the
percentage of referrers that come from each site; there appears to be little
correlation between the two. Although thanks to subdomains being listed
separately in Google's referrer data, these percentages may be artificially
low - an attempt has been made to combine the more obvious ones such as
'blog.' vs 'www' but only where such data was readily available.
