# Referrer Analysis

Data extracted from Google Analytics showing which links the people who are
visiting our sites have clicked to reach us.

From studying this data we appear to have two types of site - those which get
most of their referral traffic from social media sites (with Facebook comfortably
leading the pack these days in nearly all territories) and a smaller group which
get referrals from more diverse sources, typically a mix of partner
organisations, campaign groups and news sites.

Typically referral traffic only accounts for between 7 and 13 percent of sessions
to any of the sites we have looked at (as of February 2016) although further
analysis should reveal whether this changes as a site grows - our working theory
is that once a sizeable amount of high quality content is published on the site,
search traffic starts to take over - or remains fairly constant.

### UK

#### All time (May 2010 - 25 February 2016)

Overall percentage data for this period may not be wholly accurate as the
dataset is large enough for Google to start using data sampling (representing
1.03% of the whole) to produce statistics in a timely fashion.

Across this time period, referrals account for 3.25% of traffic to the site.

| Position | Referring site | Sector | Percentage | 
| :------: | -------------- | -------| -------: |
| 1  | Twitter               | Social Media | 19.94% |
| 2  | Facebook (web)        | Social Media |  8.38% |
| 3  | Facebook (mobile)     | Social Media |  7.39% |
| 4  | Google (UK)           | Search Engine|  2.69% |
| 5  | immigrationboards.com | Forum        |  2.30% |
| 6  | thestudentroom.co.uk  | Forum        |  2.16% |

## Limitations

There seems to be an oddity in Google's default "Channel" categorisation for
traffic sources which results in traffic from the same site being reported across
multiple categories. From the channel names it seems reasonable to assume that
Facebook and Twitter traffic should appear under "Social" instead of "Referral"
whereas in reality they appear in both, possibly depending on the format of the
link that was used - the internet is uncharacteristically unhelpful in finding the detail of what's actually going on here. Similarly some stray hits from Yahoo's
search subdomain (although it's possible that these may not be search results)
are also being classified as "Referral" instead of "Search" so there's something
a bit odd happening here.

While it's at least theoretically possible [to correct for this using Google's
own software](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6010097?hl=en) either
by manually fiddling with the default classifications (which sounds like a fun
new way to break your reporting data for all time) or creating custom ones, this
does not seem like a worthwhile activity as it can't be applied to existing data
and will make comparisons between sites (and between historical and new traffic
data on the same site) difficult, if not impossible to make sense of.

"All time" traffic results may not be reliable in all cases:
 * changes to channel classifications over time (more likely for the older sites)
 may skew the headline categorisation figures
 * if the dataset gets large enough (a problem which is so far unique to
 WhatDoTheyKnow), Google will switch to using representative data sampling
 rather than trying to do on-demand calculations on the whole set (which may
 provide a near-identical result but we can never be sure!)

This data is only available for sites that have Google Analytics set
up and where the site owners have kindly granted us access to have a look around.
