Where did the traffic come from in the first couple of years of
WhatDoTheyKnow? Let's dig into the site analytics and find out.

## Answer

**TL;DR:** We're not entirely sure.

## Analysis

Turns out we weren't using Google Analytics back in 2008 when WDTK was
launched and we don't retain log files for that long, so the oldest data
we were able to retrieve doesn't really tell us what we wanted to know.

However, just in case it's good for something here's a report drawn from
the first 2 years of our Google Analytics data.

### Traffic referrals (July 2011 - July 2013)

The top 10 referrers over this period, representing 11.29% of the overall
traffic to the site (in terms of sessions) and 9.75% of our new users
over the stated period were:
