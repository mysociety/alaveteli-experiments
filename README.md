# Alaveteli Experiments

A collection of experiments and research to learn about what makes an Alaveteli
grow.

An "experiment" is an iteration of the "Build → Measure → Learn" cycle from
[The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/).

![Build, Measure, Learn Cycle diagram](http://i.imgur.com/F95UZdm.png)

Experiments should ideally return a **yes** or **no** answer, or return a single
number in answer to a question, e.g. 89%.

Experiments are here to change our behaviour, and consequently, what we build.

Experiments should generally be focused around three areas:

- **Acquisition:** Get new users
- **Engagement:** Keep users using
- **Retention:** Stop users leaving

## Results

A summary of results from what we've tried so far. These results show what we
found given the experiment conditions. They are by no means definitive. We
encourage you to try and tweak these experiments for your Alaveteli, and let us
know what the results were.
