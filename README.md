        <strong>Yes</strong>. There is a higher success rate (and a marginally
        lower "unresolved" rate) for the first requests of people who go on to
        make further requests than for those who stop after the first one.

        <strong>Yes</strong>, Facebook ads helped to bring new users to sites, but in the majority of cases it was only a small number. Overall, 0.5% of people who saw the ads then visited an Alaveteli website.
Only one person went on to make a request after seeing a Facebook advert. However, there are indications that using Facebook ads in Uganda has led to sustained higher usage levels of the site afterwards.</strong>
